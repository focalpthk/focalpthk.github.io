            <p>This is Jason Ng. <br>Born and raised in Hong Kong. <br>I tell story through images.
              <br><br>I mainly shoot photographs in black and white.
              <br><br>And I spent 4 years of study in Physics in the university.
              (So I'm barely a Physicist hahaha!)

            <h2 id="three">What is focalpt.?</h2>
            <p>focalpt. is originated from an optical term – focal point – when an object is focused,
              its light rays are converged at the focal point and that is when you see a sharp image.
              <br><br>

              I chose this term as the title of my album (or portfolio) because I hope my creations
              could bring you the focus of certain issues and echoes my physics study.

              <p>This website is created from scratch. Why did I choose to build one myself when there were many templates I could borrow?<br><br>

                Uniqueness and the enjoyment of creating the one and only in this world are my reasons. I learnt new programming skills during this process.
                I hope this portfolio doesn't look like a conventional one and you may find interest in it.<br><br>

              <h2 id="six">From physics to taking pictures?</h2>
              <p>
                My mother bought me my first camera for astrophotography in Form 4, that time I was the chairperson of astronomy club,
                this triggered my interest into astronomy and photography. <br><br>

                Photography and physics are different, I remembered in Year 3, I found passion in taking photos of the world, the humanity living
                between light and shadow. I struggled a lot when I asked myself if I would continue my Physics study in the future or develop a
                photography career. This question led me to study a portraiture photography course offered by my university. <br><br>

                During this period of study (2019), Hong Kong was under a very intense situation of fighting for freedom regarded to the introduction
                of extradition bill. I took the chance to document this historical movement since I decided to stand aside as an observer and hoped I could
                bring myself and others different angles of the movement. At the same time, I joined university's Editorial Board as a volunteer journalist,
                stand up for justice and freedom. <br><br>

                The course and being a journalist then became a revelation of what should I focus after my graduation.
                I understood this transformation will be a hard time for me, but I hope I can follow my passion and make greater things for the world. <br><br>

              <!--<h2>Why black and white?</h2>
              <p>Black and white is raw, raw enough for you to imagine the real colour of the pictures. You and I, he or she can be any
                colours you named it, there is just deeper or paler. <br><br>B&W also has the power of telling a story, containing strong feelings
                from the pictures. So how can I not love B&W?
